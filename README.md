Java examples proven to work in CF
===============
It is allways nice to have at least a couple of non so trivial 'Hello World' examples.

* The official used by Pivotal: Spring Music

* Spring Pet Clinic

Another Java app much more complex is Jenkins (http://jenkins-ci.org). This application requires customization and workaround in order to be deployed to CF
